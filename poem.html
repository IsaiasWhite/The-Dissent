            <p>Part of the mass, now singled to your own piece<br />
              Stood with the group, but now you’re on your own feet<br />
              There was a time when no one seemed to leave you<br />
              No it seems, no one tends to see you<br />
              No longer identified with the world’s people<br />
              If they mistreat you, they did not commit a crime<br />
              Or violate your rights, because you’re not seen as equal<br />
              And you’re not, because of what’s in the inside<br />
              It’s like a star, because it heats as it shines<br />
              But it doesn’t need a stage to bring attention to it’s light<br />
              You won’t blaze for the moment, and burnout by the morning<br />
              But wax for the torn, and shed for the mourning<br />
              This isn’t ordinary, to most intimidating<br />
              That you of no value exceeded expectations<br />
              If they won’t detain you, self will restrain you<br />
              But none can stop the truth, if you’re available</p>

            <p>All have the pine in their eyes to be great<br />
              But can you lionize the lives soaked in strife<br />
              To toss a lifeline in the seas made of their crying<br />
              Be a spark to the flame of the soul for their drying<br />
              Most of us just aspire<br />
              As long as we keep eating, other’s lives can expire<br />
              But I feel we come to a choice in our lives<br />
              To be glutenous in self, or stop eating the plate of lies<br />
              Fasting from self, to try and fasten yourself<br />
              To a diet that is fashioned for health<br />
              Cease from living through appetites, to ample life<br />
              Beyond the desires to postpone death/<br />
              Claiming you’re living to the fullest, sounds foolish<br />
              When nothing trickles down during your constant moving<br />
              Leaving the vessels under you half empty and destitute<br />
              To the brim you weren’t filled, cause space wasn’t available<br /></p>

          </div>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>There’s more to life than what we see right before us.<br />
              Getting caught in “could’s” and “would’s”, it’ll get as thick as a forest.<br />
              There’s more to life than the ability to touch.<br />
              Because once that thing is gone, you won’t feel much.<br />
              There’s more to life than things that are satisfying.<br />
              As long as you have eyes, you won’t fill the voids in your iris.<br />
              There’s more to life than bodies that attract.<br />
              If it doesn’t know love, then it won’t love back.<br />
              Which means there’s more to life than knowing one another.<br />
              If I don’t know me, how could I know another.<br />
              But there’s more to life than the existence of your views.<br />
              Wisdom is not gained from disclosing your own truth.<br />
              And, there’s more to life than the life of your struggles.<br />
              All have strife, and none is worse than another’s.<br />
              Not to blind you, just trying to shed light<br />
              On the truth, that there’s more to life.</p>

            <p>There’s more to life than all the worlds cash.<br />
              It can’t buy love, peace, and grace that’ll last.<br />
              There’s more to life than women that are fast.<br />
              Because at the right speed, you’re sure to lose track.<br />
              There’s more to life than having a lot of stones.<br />
              Possibly all the ice may make one emotionless.<br />
              So, there’s more to life than being the coolest.<br />
              Because the hottest trends are growing cold.<br />
              There’s more to life than trying to please people.<br />
              If you favor one, the others feel unequal.<br />
              So, there’s more to life than what they say.<br />
              Keep your eyes focused and follow what’s been paved.<br />
              There’s more to life than the world’s deafness.<br />
              You know you heard a word, they don’t want you to listen.<br />
              They may frown because you shine too bright,<br />
              But show them that there’s more to life.<br /></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been around here for a minute.<br />
              You thought I left, but I&#39;m still up in this.<br />
              Real adversaries will always tarry<br />
              For your demise, if they are living.<br />
              I have some work that I haven&#39;t finished.<br />
              I am the hurt of you daily grimace.<br />
              You&#39;ve been distracted, I&#39;ve been relaxing<br />
              Because you believe there&#39;s bigger business.<br />
              Because you perceive there&#39;s better interest.<br />
              And you grieve in their disappearance.<br />
              But, their importance is a distortion<br />
              Of your life and the way you live it.<br />
              Maybe you can see me very vivid.<br />
              But, you are scared of my existence.<br />
              So, you cover up with the other stuff<br />
              To take your mind off your condition.<br />
              Trying to act like we&#39;re not conflicting,<br /> 
              And I&#39;m not really fucking with your feelings.<br />
              But to get rid of THIS, you must be intimate<br />
              With yourself and with the enemy.<br />
              Or, you too will become a villain.<br /> 
              Viewing the world with a very cynic<br />
              Type of mindset, thinking you found it<br />
              Because you express your hurt in excess.<br />
              Believing a cold heart gave you access<br />
              To all the facts of Life&#39;s secrets.<br /> 
              But, that&#39;s not possible without control.<br />
              See, your revelations are from my genesis.<br />
              Every step you took, I was the cause of it.<br />
              Everything you made, I was the elements.<br />
              I devoured all of the power<br />
              The very hour that you neglected me.<br />
              So, sweep me under the rug.<br />
              The dirt will soon pile up.<br />
              I know how big your closet is.<br />
              There&#39;s not enough room for the skeletons.<br />
              Because you share things in marriages,<br />
              And bondage is what this marriage is.<br />
              Don&#39;t you think that I&#39;ll just pack and leave.<br />
              I&#39;ll wear this ring until you get rid of me.<br />
              ... So face me.<br />

            <p>It’s the only thing I have to give.<br />
              It’s the only reason I rise to live.<br />

              It’s because of this you notice me.<br />
              I was confused of its existence.<br />

              Thought it would be earned with my labor,<br />
              But it’s my work to share it with my neighbor.<br />
              Daily, it was perfected.<br />
              For the moments to share it, in discretion.<br />
              But Wisdom says give it unfiltered,<br />
              So that at my lowest others are lifted.<br />
              So, this is the last judgement.<br />
              A death sentence to future grudges.<br />
              The new law under the present verdict.<br />

              Good is right, and goodness knows<br />
              That good is light, and good is hope.<br />
              Things progress, when goodness is shown.<br />
              That is truth, because progression is growth.<br />
              When hidden, goodness remains.<br />
              Some things are good riddance, if they refuse change.<br />
              Good is balance, when you are challenged.<br />
              Allow the good in you to overwhelm malice.<br />
              Don’t manage goodness, it flows unhindered.<br />
              If it’s truly good, it needs no mentor.<br />
              It’s good to learn. Goodness will teach.<br />
              It’s good to show, because goodness will seek.<br />
              And, if you are closed goodness will breach.<br />
              But if you choose to deny, goodness will leave.<br />

              All men that’ve died,<br />

              To become barren and no longer sustained.<br />
              I know the outlet I need for life.<br />
              Lightning’s Creator, better than generators<br />
              That are used to power cities.<br />
              But they don’t last forever.<br />
              And if they did, wouldn’t fill me.<br />

              From the beginning I’m praying for my insolence<br />
              Forgiveness for these words that are coming from my feelings<br />
              But please don’t ignore the rants of my ignorance<br />
              What I vent is the steam I’m tired of covering<br />
              Loneliness, hopelessness, the time between messages<br />
              Enemy attacks that makes it hard to keep focus with<br />
              The call that was made for me<br />
              I see nothing forming, though I’ve put my heart in it<br />
              My neck has grown weary, I’m not trying to look down<br />
              Waiting to rise upon wings, while being wise like the owl<br />
              Perched on my porch, tempted to stoop down<br />
              None of the kids play with the stoop child<br />
              These thoughts are hard to post, I decided to mail them<br />
              But sure enough they were returned to cinder<br />
              Was told a flame starts from glowing embers<br />
              Keeping my heart warm and my mind kindled<br />
              Brilliant in the depths of life’s amazon<br />
              So I can see underneath the trees’ canopy<br />
              It gets dark down here by the roots<br />
              What’s to expect when you really search for you<br />
              Digging deeper than the bark, until I tap the sap<br />
              It started so bitter, but I can make syrup from that<br />
              I mean telling my strife through a man’s fear of tears<br />
              Showing when life is bitter, it gets sweeter if you persevere<br />
