              <p>
                Part of the mass, now singled to your own piece<br />
                Stood with the group, but now you’re on your own feet<br />
                There was a time when no one seemed to leave you<br />
                No it seems, no one tends to see you<br />
                No longer identified with the world’s people<br />
                If they mistreat you, they did not commit a crime<br />
                Or violate your rights, because you’re not seen as equal<br />
                And you’re not, because of what’s in the inside<br />
                It’s like a star, because it heats as it shines<br />
                But it doesn’t need a stage to bring attention to it’s light<br />
                You won’t blaze for the moment, and burnout by the morning<br />
                But wax for the torn, and shed for the mourning<br />
                This isn’t ordinary, to most intimidating<br />
                That you of no value exceeded expectations<br />
                If they won’t detain you, self will restrain you<br />
                But none can stop the truth, if you’re available
              </p>

              <p>
                All have the pine in their eyes to be great<br />
                But can you lionize the lives soaked in strife<br />
                To toss a lifeline in the seas made of their crying<br />
                Be a spark to the flame of the soul for their drying<br />
                Most of us just aspire<br />
                As long as we keep eating, other’s lives can expire<br />
                But I feel we come to a choice in our lives<br />
                To be glutenous in self, or stop eating the plate of lies<br />
                Fasting from self, to try and fasten yourself<br />
                To a diet that is fashioned for health<br />
                Cease from living through appetites, to ample life<br />
                Beyond the desires to postpone death/<br />
                Claiming you’re living to the fullest, sounds foolish<br />
                When nothing trickles down during your constant moving<br />
                Leaving the vessels under you half empty and destitute<br />
                To the brim you weren’t filled, cause space wasn’t available<br />

              <p>
                There’s more to life than what we see right before us.<br />
                Getting caught in “could’s” and “would’s”, it’ll get as thick as
                a forest.<br />
                There’s more to life than the ability to touch.<br />
                Because once that thing is gone, you won’t feel much.<br />
                There’s more to life than things that are satisfying.<br />
                As long as you have eyes, you won’t fill the voids in your
                iris.<br />
                There’s more to life than bodies that attract.<br />
                If it doesn’t know love, then it won’t love back.<br />
                Which means there’s more to life than knowing one another.<br />
                If I don’t know me, how could I know another.<br />
                But there’s more to life than the existence of your views.<br />
                Wisdom is not gained from disclosing your own truth.<br />
                And, there’s more to life than the life of your struggles.<br />
                All have strife, and none is worse than another’s.<br />
                Not to blind you, just trying to shed light<br />
                On the truth, that there’s more to life.
              </p>

              <p>
                There’s more to life than all the worlds cash.<br />
                It can’t buy love, peace, and grace that’ll last.<br />
                There’s more to life than women that are fast.<br />
                Because at the right speed, you’re sure to lose track.<br />
                There’s more to life than having a lot of stones.<br />
                Possibly all the ice may make one emotionless.<br />
                So, there’s more to life than being the coolest.<br />
                Because the hottest trends are growing cold.<br />
                There’s more to life than trying to please people.<br />
                If you favor one, the others feel unequal.<br />
                So, there’s more to life than what they say.<br />
                Keep your eyes focused and follow what’s been paved.<br />
                There’s more to life than the world’s deafness.<br />
                You know you heard a word, they don’t want you to listen.<br />
                They may frown because you shine too bright,<br />
                But show them that there’s more to life.<br />

                I&#39;ve been around here for a minute.<br />
                You thought I left, but I&#39;m still up in this.<br />
                Real adversaries will always tarry<br />
                For your demise, if they are living.<br />
                I have some work that I haven&#39;t finished.<br />
                I am the hurt of you daily grimace.<br />
                You&#39;ve been distracted, I&#39;ve been relaxing<br />
                Because you believe there&#39;s bigger business.<br />
                Because you perceive there&#39;s better interest.<br />
                And you grieve in their disappearance.<br />
                But, their importance is a distortion<br />
                Of your life and the way you live it.<br />
                Maybe you can see me very vivid.<br />
                But, you are scared of my existence.<br />
                So, you cover up with the other stuff<br />
                To take your mind off your condition.<br />
                Trying to act like we&#39;re not conflicting,<br />  And I&#39;m
                not really fucking with your feelings.<br />
                But to get rid of THIS, you must be intimate<br />
                With yourself and with the enemy.<br />
                Or, you too will become a villain.<br />  Viewing the world with
                a very cynic<br />
                Type of mindset, thinking you found it<br />
                Because you express your hurt in excess.<br />
                Believing a cold heart gave you access<br />
                To all the facts of Life&#39;s secrets.<br />  But, that&#39;s
                not possible without control.<br />
                See, your revelations are from my genesis.<br />
                Every step you took, I was the cause of it.<br />
                Everything you made, I was the elements.<br />
                I devoured all of the power<br />
                The very hour that you neglected me.<br />
                So, sweep me under the rug.<br />
                The dirt will soon pile up.<br />
                I know how big your closet is.<br />
                There&#39;s not enough room for the skeletons.<br />
                Because you share things in marriages,<br />
                And bondage is what this marriage is.<br />
                Don&#39;t you think that I&#39;ll just pack and leave.<br />
                I&#39;ll wear this ring until you get rid of me.<br />
                ... So face me.<br />

                It’s the only thing I have to give.<br />
                It’s the only reason I rise to live.<br />
                It’s the greater part of my identity.<br />
                It’s because of this you notice me.<br />
                I was confused of its existence.<br />
                Thought it was something that needed seeking.<br />
                Thought it would be earned with my labor,<br />
                But it’s my work to share it with my neighbor.<br />
                Daily, it was perfected.<br />
                For the moments to share it, in discretion.<br />
                But Wisdom says give it unfiltered,<br />
                So that at my lowest others are lifted.<br />
                So, this is the last judgement.<br />
                A death sentence to future grudges.<br />
                The new law under the present verdict.<br />

                Good is life, and good is love.<br />
                Gift the good. Oh, and good trust.<br />
                Good is right, and goodness knows<br />
                That good is light, and good is hope.<br />
                Things progress, when goodness is shown.<br />
                That is truth, because progression is growth.<br />
                When hidden, goodness remains.<br />
                Some things are good riddance, if they refuse change.<br />
                Good is balance, when you are challenged.<br />
                Allow the good in you to overwhelm malice.<br />
                Don’t manage goodness, it flows unhindered.<br />
                If it’s truly good, it needs no mentor.<br />
                It’s good to learn. Goodness will teach.<br />
                It’s good to show, because goodness will seek.<br />
                And, if you are closed goodness will breach.<br />
                But if you choose to deny, goodness will leave.<br />

                And experience the gifts of this sealed box.<br />
                Some will start and before their cut, stop.<br />
                Though no one has to be disqualified,<br />
                Some will drop themselves, spiritual suicide.<br />
                It’s your decision to put your shoes aside.<br />
                But if you don’t run, you still chose a side.<br />
                That’s for those who presume they’ll get by,<br />
                Just because they didn’t decide to fight.<br />
                And, attempt to endure to the finish.<br />
                Stride for life, not to be in the Guinness.<br />
                Yet, some feel bliss is in ignorance.<br />
                But ignoring a problem, means you’re still in it.<br />

                Do I stress to express the things that I believe?<br />
                Should I focus on the way it’ll be perceived?<br />
                I know it’s more important to the roots of the tree,<br />

                What you thought was falling to die,<br />

                Not in the sense of a martyr.<br />
                Decay isn’t the only fertilizer.<br />
                As fertilizing may happen through the living,<br />
                Autumn’s downfall may not be what it seems.<br />
                As she’s stripped away of what’s been given.<br />
                We call her finished, but she means new beginning.<br />
                Understand you won’t grow anew,<br />
                Until you share your present fruit.<br />
                If the gift wastes out of fearing their taste,<br />
                Is there a point of protecting you?<br />

                From the beginning I’m praying for my insolence<br />
                Forgiveness for these words that are coming from my feelings<br />
                But please don’t ignore the rants of my ignorance<br />
                What I vent is the steam I’m tired of covering<br />
                Loneliness, hopelessness, the time between messages<br />
                Enemy attacks that makes it hard to keep focus with<br />
                The call that was made for me<br />
                I see nothing forming, though I’ve put my heart in it<br />
                My neck has grown weary, I’m not trying to look down<br />
                Waiting to rise upon wings, while being wise like the owl<br />
                Perched on my porch, tempted to stoop down<br />
                None of the kids play with the stoop child<br />
                These thoughts are hard to post, I decided to mail them<br />
                But sure enough they were returned to cinder<br />
                Was told a flame starts from glowing embers<br />
                Keeping my heart warm and my mind kindled<br />
                Brilliant in the depths of life’s amazon<br />
                So I can see underneath the trees’ canopy<br />
                It gets dark down here by the roots<br />
                What’s to expect when you really search for you<br />
                Digging deeper than the bark, until I tap the sap<br />
                It started so bitter, but I can make syrup from that<br />
                I mean telling my strife through a man’s fear of tears<br />
                Showing when life is bitter, it gets sweeter if you persevere<br />
